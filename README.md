## Overview

This document provides an overview of the creation and application of an AI system designed to suggest exercises. This system leverages the RandomForest Classifier, a machine learning classification algorithm. A multi-output classification strategy is employed to suggest a variety of exercises based on specific inputs. This document covers the steps involved in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
